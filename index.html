    	<h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>The Kapiti Gymnastics Club, a not for profit community focused organisation, was established 30 years ago and has been housed in its own gym for over 10 years now. 
        Without our great team of employees, volunteer coaches and board members, we would not have the great facility we have today. 
        All of our programmes are gymnastics skills based while also developing childrenâ€™s confidence, co-ordination and flexibility. 
        Our main focus is for children to have fun and learn in a safe environment.</p>
